//JAVASCRIPT FUNCTIONS IN ALL THEIR VARIOUS GUISES

//1. FUNCTION DECLARATION

function variableName (parameter) {
    //code to be executed
    //return code
}
//N.B NO SEMI-COLON AT THE END

variableName(argument);
//CALLS THE FUNCTION


//2a. ARROW SYNTAX REFACTED

const volumeOfSphere = diameter =>
  (1/6) * Math.PI * diameter * diameter * diameter;

//NOTES ON ARROW SYNTAX: 
1. Functions that take a single parameter should not use parentheses. 
The code will still work, but it's better practice to omit the parentheses around single parameters. 
However, if a function takes zero or multiple parameters, parentheses are required.
2. A function composed of a sole single-line block is automatically returned. 
The contents of the block should immediately follow the arrow => and the return keyword can be removed. 
This is referred to as implicit return.
3. A function composed of a sole single-line block does not need brackets

//2b. ARROW SYNTAX - WITH EXTRAS

const variableName = (parameterOne, parameterTwo) => {
    //code to be executed
    //return code
};

variableName(argument); 
//CALLS THE FUNCTION

//3. FUNCTION EXPRESSIONS 

const square = function (number) {
  return number * number;
};

square(number);
